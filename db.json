          ],
          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "In Java, the correct way to declare a variable is to use a type followed by the variable name and value, such as 'int number = 10;'."

          "question": "Sarah is trying to calculate the size of an array in Java. She creates an array with 5 integers: int[] numbers = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};. Then she writes the following code to get the array's size: System.out.println(\"Array size: \" + numbers.length); She thinks the array's size will be 6. Does that sound about right?",

          ],
          "answer": 1,
          "explanation": "In Java, the array size is the number of elements in the array. The array 'numbers' has 5 elements, so its size is 5, not 6."

          "answer": 0,
          "explanation": "The '//' operator in Python is used for floor division, which divides the two numbers and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result. So, 10 // 5 equals 2."
